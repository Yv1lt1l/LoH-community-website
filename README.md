# LoH-community-website

This is for the LoH: Gargoyles' Garden Discord Server. It's a community project.

The nature of this project means that i know who has access. All i ask is that you discuss with me before changing the JS file. the HTML and CSS are non destructive and easily changed so i dont care much.
